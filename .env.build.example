# Build Configuration for Custom Steam Dashboard
#
# This file contains environment variables that will be embedded into
# the executable during build process.
#
# IMPORTANT:
# 1. Copy this file to .env before building
# 2. Fill in your production values
# 3. Never commit the real .env file to repository!
#
# Usage:
#   cp .env.build.example .env
#   # Edit .env with your values
#   ./build_executable.sh

# ===== Client Configuration (will be embedded in executable) =====

# Server URL - where the backend API is running
SERVER_URL=https://custom-steam-dashboard.pl.eu.org

# Client ID - identifier for this desktop application
CLIENT_ID=desktop-main

# Client Secret - must match the secret configured in server's CLIENTS_JSON
# Generate with: python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret-here

# ===== Build Notes =====
#
# After building, these values will be embedded in the executable.
# Users won't need to configure anything - the app will work immediately!
#
# Security:
# - The .env file with real secrets should NOT be committed to repository
# - Add .env to .gitignore (already done)
# - The config.py file is safe to commit (no hardcoded secrets)
# - Client secret will be visible in the built executable to determined users
#   (this is acceptable for desktop apps with limited permissions)
